# Gmail-Phishing-Page
Newer Login Page clone for gmail

This is a slighty newer phishing page for gmail, it works will with both Shellphish and HiddenEye.
Just delete the old gmail html page and replace it with this one.



You can find the old gmail html page this way:
1. cd shellphish/sites/gmail
2. rm -rf login.html
3. cp (This Page) shellphish/sites/gmail/login.html
