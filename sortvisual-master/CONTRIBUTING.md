## How to Contribute?
There is no initial setup required to start contributing to the project. But you must follow these guidelines while contributing to the project:
- If you are applying any logic, make sure to comment that well.
- Make sure to write clean code (use functions wherever necessary)

## How to claim an issue?
You can simply claim an issue by following these steps:
1. Go to issues section
2. Find an issue to work on
3. If no one is assigned to that issue feel free to claim that issue by commenting **working**, or if someone is already assigned but there is no PR from past 7 days then feel free to claim that issue and the issue will be assigned to you
4. Fix that issue or make the required changes
5. Make the PR

**Done!** :tada:
